## Game Installer Creation

Research about Setup Installer Projects.

Hi, I'm Jose, a student in CITM. This is a class for Project2 subject.

### Installation

Installation is the configuration of a software or hardware with a view to making it usable with the computer.

Installation typically involves code (program) being copied/generated from the installation files to new files on the local computer for easier access by the operating system, creating necessary directories, registering environment variables, providing separate program for un-installation etc.

There are different types of installations:

-**Attended installation**

Most common form of installation. An installation process usually needs a user who attends it to make choices, specifying preferences such as the installation location, supplying passwords or assisting in product activation. For instance, if the disk in which the computer program is being installed was full, the installer may ask the user to specify another target path or clear enough space in the disk.

-**Silent installation**

Installation that does not display messages or windows during its progress. All silent installations are unattended but not all unattended installations are silent. Malware and viruses can be installed silently when a person clicks on a link while working at a business they think is real but is a hacker's program download. Silently installing a software can be used to deploy a program on networks in educational institutions.

-**Unattended installation**

Installation that is performed without user interaction during its progress or with no user present at all. One of the reasons to use this approach is to automate the installation of a large number of systems. An unattended installation either does not require the user to supply anything or has received all necessary input prior to the start of installation.

-**Headless installation**

Installation performed without using a computer monitor connected. In attended forms of headless installation, another machine connects to the target machine and takes over the display output.

-**Scheduled or automated installation**

Process that runs on a preset time or when a predefined condition transpires.

-**Clean installation**

Is done in the absence of any interfering elements such as old versions of the computer program being installed or leftovers from a previous installation.

-**Network installation**

Network installation, is an installation of a program from a shared network resource that may be done by installing a minimal system before proceeding to download further packages over the network. This may simply be a copy of the original media but software publishers which offer site licenses for institutional customers may provide a version intended for installation over a network.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/JedTyde/Game-Installer-Creation/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
